Class Bug class represents each bug in the game. 
Bugs are created with a random position on the screen and move in random directions. 
Clicking on a bug triggers the squash method, which increments the score and removes the bug from the screen.
The Game class manages the game logic. It keeps track of the score and timer, starts and ends the game,
generates bugs at regular intervals, and increments the score when a bug is squashed.
